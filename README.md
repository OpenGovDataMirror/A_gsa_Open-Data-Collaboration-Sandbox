Open-Data-Collaboration-Sandbox
===============================

## What is this?  

This repository is meant to provide a home for documentation, directions, and pointers for several pilot projects for open data in government.  The [homepage](http://gsa.github.io/Open-Data-Collaboration-Sandbox/) serves as an index, each link going to a discrete project, sometimes stored in a single markdown page or a repository.    

Each project homepage tries to contain a brief background and relevant links, but then will also include either an outline for the wider project or - over time - a more fleshed out presence for it.  

At the end of the day, this repository is a sandbox to allow the beginnings of projects to take place in an open source environment where others can follow and contribute as they see fit.  

## Who is the intended audience?  

This varies from project to project, but is usually government employees who are working on data, api, and open government projects.  In many cases, only some of the projects will be relevant to visitors but for some, but this will range depending on how specific or broard the visitor's purview is.    

## How can I contribute?  

Issues and pull requests are welcome.
