Home, sweet home.

## 18th and F Southwast

There is no 18th and F SW or if there is, it's in the Tidal Basin, close to the FDR memorial.

## 18th and F Southeast

There is no 18th and F SE.  It would be in Congressional Cemetary, but actually there's not even a F Street in Southeast *until you cross the Anacostia River*.  Lord knows why.

## 18th and F Northeast 

I don't even know what to say here, but it would seem that the city planners really went out of their way to have 18th and F NW be a truly unique place.
